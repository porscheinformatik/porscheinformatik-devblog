## What is this `anti-mapper`?

[anti-mapper](https://github.com/porscheinformatik/anti-mapper) is a Java library, that assists the manual mapping of entities and DTOs.

In contrast to complex mapping frameworks, the anti-mapper comes with absolutely **no reflection** and guarantees **zero magic**. It offers **no configuration** at all and shines with a **learing curve flat as a pancake**.

Nevertheless, it is capable to boost your **"I am faster doing it manually"-approach**, because it helps you where it gets complicated: mapping sets, lists and maps. Additionally, it unifies your mapping efforts by offering consistent interfaces and base classes. 

[Check it out](https://github.com/porscheinformatik/anti-mapper).
